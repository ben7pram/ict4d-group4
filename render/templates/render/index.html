    In this project, we aim to create a system that will provide farmers of rain-fed agriculture with information on weather and climate – as it relates to the seeding of crops – using automatically generated voice messages in English, Dagbani and French. 
    For the purpose of this project, the focus is on the three main crops grown in the community: Maize, Ground Nuts, and Soy Beans. Rainfall data will be collected for use in the system in two ways. 
    Firstly, farmers will be able to use the system to report their assessment of the amount of rainfall on the previous day, using the categories storm, heavy rain, moderate rain, and drizzle. 
    Second, members of the local community will be reading the measurements on rain collectors placed around the area, with these measurements being collected into a central database.
    
    A  basic database is created and a simple backend (Django default /admin) data entry screen for Weather and Crop Information is enabled. 
    The database model is shown below for reference.
