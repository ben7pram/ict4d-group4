        In this project, we aim to create a system that will provide farmers of rain-fed agriculture with information
        on weather and climate – as it relates to the seeding of crops – using automatically generated voice messages
        in English, Dagbani and French. For the purpose of this project, the focus is on the three main crops grown in the
        community: maize, groundnuts, and soy beans. Rainfall data will be collected for use in the system in two ways. Firstly, farmers will be able to use the system
        to report their assessment of the amount of rainfall on the previous day, using the categories storm, heavy
        rain, moderate rain, and drizzle. Second, members of the local community will be reading the measurements
        on rain collectors placed around the area, with these measurements being collected into a central database.
