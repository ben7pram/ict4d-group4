In this project, we aim to create a system that will provide farmers of rain-fed agriculture with information
on weather and climate – as it relates to the seeding of crops – using automatically generated voice messages
in Dagbani. The area is the Sahel region in northern Ghana, which has extreme periods of rain and drought.
The information is essential to the farmers, but lacking. There are experts, but their information is not
always accurate. The system could therefore help to increase the overall yield of the crops.
The system will combine weather information collected from the local community with expert information
on crop calendars. The main goal is to use this information to advise farmers on what crop to grow, and
when to start seeding it. For the purpose of this project, the focus is on the three main crops grown in the
community: maize, groundnuts, and soy beans.
Rainfall data will be collected for use in the system in two ways. Firstly, farmers will be able to use the system
to report their assessment of the amount of rainfall on the previous day, using the categories storm, heavy
rain, moderate rain, and drizzle. Second, members of the local community will be reading the measurements
on rain collectors placed around the area, with these measurements being collected into a central database.
